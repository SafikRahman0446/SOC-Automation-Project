# SOC-Automation-Project
SOC Automation Project â€“ An end-to-end Security Operations Center (SOC) automation lab integrating Wazuh (SIEM + EDR), TheHive (Incident Response), Shuffle (SOAR), and VirusTotal (Threat Intelligence). Includes attack simulation with Mimikatz on Windows 10, automated alert enrichment, case creation, and SOC team notifications.

### ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- **Wazuh** â€“ SIEM + EDR (Log collection & monitoring)
- **TheHive** â€“ Incident Response Platform
- **Shuffle** â€“ SOAR automation workflows
- **VirusTotal** â€“ Threat Intelligence API
- **Windows 10** â€“ Endpoint with Wazuh Agent + Mimikatz (attack simulation)
- **Ubuntu 22.04** â€“ Hosting TheHive & Shuffle
- **Ubuntu** â€“ Hosting Wazuh Manager

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. **Attack Simulation**:
   - On Windows 10, **Mimikatz** is executed to simulate credential dumping.
   - Logs are collected by the **Wazuh Agent**.

2. **Log Analysis**:
   - Logs are forwarded to **Wazuh Manager**.
   - Alerts are triggered based on detection rules.

3. **Automation with Shuffle**:
   - Alerts are sent via **Webhook â†’ Shuffle Workflow**.
   - Workflow extracts SHA256 file hashes from the alert.
   - Hashes are checked in **VirusTotal** for reputation.

4. **Automated Response**:
   - If malicious â†’ **Case is created in TheHive** for incident investigation.
   - **Email Notification** is sent to SOC team with details.
     
## Usage

- **Monitor logs and alerts in real-time.**

- **Check incident tickets in TheHive automatically created by Shuffle playbooks.**

- **Scan suspicious files/URLs with VirusTotal integration.**
  
- **Send email to Analyst.**

## Conclusion

This SOC Automation project demonstrates how to integrate multiple security toolsâ€”**Wazuh Manager**, **TheHive**, **Shuffle**, and **VirusTotal**â€”to build a fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC) lab.  

Through this project, you can:  
- Collect and monitor logs from Windows and Linux endpoints.  
- Detect and respond to security threats automatically.  
- Create and manage incidents efficiently with TheHive.  
- Enrich alerts with threat intelligence from VirusTotal.  

The project serves as a practical example of SOC automation, showing how orchestration and alert correlation can improve security monitoring and incident response. It also provides a foundation for further experimentation, such as adding new playbooks, integrating additional security tools, or simulating advanced attack scenarios in a lab environment.  

By completing this project, users gain hands-on experience with core SOC technologies, automated workflows, and incident response processes, preparing them for real-world cybersecurity operations.
